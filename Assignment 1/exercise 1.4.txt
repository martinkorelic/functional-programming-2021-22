double 5 = incr (incr 0)
  where incr y = 5 + y

=> { definition of incr }

double 5 = incr (5 + 0)
  where incr y = 5 + y

=> { definition of + }

double 5 = incr 5
  where incr y = 5 + y

=> { definition of incr }

double 5 = 5 + 5
  where incr y = 5 + y

=> { definition of + }

double 5 = 10

So the result of double 5 is 10. The evaluationorder we used is the applicative order evaluation, since we
first reduced the arguments.
